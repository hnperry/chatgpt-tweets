# ChatGPT Tweets Sentiment Analysis 

![ChatGPT-Header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116209783/233449495-96b3dfb1-3885-4612-bfef-cc44b14df5a1.jpg)

## 0.1 Intent
I am performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets about chatGPT. The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charunisa/chatgpt-sentiment-analysis).

## 0.2 Dataset Features
This dataset contains a month's worth of tweets about chatGPT sampled in early 2023. NLP sentiment analysis was performed on the tweets, assigning them 'good', 'neutral', or 'bad' sentiments.

**Labels (Sentiment)**
- Good = 1
- Neutral = 0
- Bad = -1

**Tweets**
- Textual data of the tweets

Let's check out the data

```
import pandas as pd

df=pd.read_csv("gpt_raw_tweets.csv")
print(df.head())
```

```
   Unnamed: 0                                             tweets   labels
0           0  ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialog...  neutral
1           1  Try talking with ChatGPT, our new AI system wh...     good
2           2  ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialog...  neutral
3           3  THRILLED to share that ChatGPT, our new model ...     good
4           4  As of 2 minutes ago, @OpenAI released their ne...      bad
```

## 1. Preprocessing
### 1.1 Clean the data

We don't need the "Unnamed:0" column, so let's drop that.

```
df=df.drop(df.columns[0], axis=1)
```

First, we will replace the sentiment labels with numeric representations. 1 for good, 0 for neutral, -1 for bad.

```
#A method to replace sentiment text data with numerical data
def encoder(x):
    if x=='good':
        return 1
    elif x=='bad':
        return -1
    else:
        return 0
        
df['labels'] = df['labels'].apply(encoder)
```

Now, we can check out the text data of the first 10 tweets to see what steps we should take in cleaning

```
print("Dirty tweets:")
for i in df.tweets.head(10):
    print(i)
```

```

This text data is dirty needs to be cleaned! In the text, we can observe what needs to be removed: links, hashtags, emojis, @ symbols, newlines, extra spaces, etc... The below method uses regex to remove specific unwanted aspects I observed in the data.

```
import re

#A method to clean text data of the tweets
def tweetcleaner(df, column):
    #convert all text to lowercase
    df[column] = df[column].str.lower()
    #remove newlines
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r"\S+\\nhttp\S+", "", regex=True)
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r"(\\n*)\S+", " ", regex=True)
    #remove urls
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r"\S+http\S+", "", regex=True)
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r"http\S+", "", regex=True)
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r"http", "", regex=True)
    #remove @ signs
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r"@\S+", "", regex=True)
    #remove words with numbers inside words
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r'\w*[0-9]\w*', "", regex=True)
    #remove all other weird characters
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r"[^A-Za-z0-9()!?@\'\`\"\_]", " ", regex=True)
    #change multiple spaces to single spaces
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r'\s+', " ", regex=True)
    #remove all single characters
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(r'\s+[a-zA-Z]\s+', ' ', regex=True)

    return df

df = tweetcleaner(df, 'tweets')
df.to_csv("gpt_clean_tweets.csv")

#Print the first 10 cleaned tweets
print("Clean Tweets:")
for i in df.tweets.head(10):
    print(i)
```

After applying the tweetcleaner method, our tweets look like this:

```
